# Tucil2_13521081_13521114 - Closest Pair Finder
Find Closest Pair of Points in Multidimensional Plane
> IF2211 Algorithm Strategies 2022/2023 Mini Project 2

## Description
This program uses both `Divide and Conquer` and `Brute Force` algorithms to provide two different approaches for finding the closest pair of points in a multidimensional plane.

The input parameters of the program consist of `d`, which represent the size of the plane's dimension and `n`, which represents the number of points. The program will then generate `n` randomly located points in a `d`-dimensional plane.

Then the program will search for the closest pair of points using the `Brute Force` and `Divide and Conquer` algorithms, and compare their performance.

The program can also perform visualization for 2D and 3D planes.
